# Fizzbuzz in JavaScript practice

## Description
A program that takes numbers and determines the outcome depending on the input.

If the number is divisible by 3 then `Fizz` will be printed to the screen.
If the number is divisble by 5 then `Buzz` will be printed to the screen.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 then `FizzBuzz` will be printed to the screen.

We followed a ping pong pairing style to complete this challenge.
